# 📊 Data Analysis | 📈 Data Science Apprentice | 🐍 Python | 🗄️SQL

Welcome to my data science portfolio! Below are details from my latest projects. 

## Time Series Forecasting with Python 🐍
- Prepared a real-world dataset for effective modelling
- Built and evaluated forecasting models comparing a seasonal naive baseline against SARIMA
- Interpreted outputs for business application

### Overview
The object was to extract and prepare a time series dataset, create a benchmark time series forecast, and evaluate this against a SARIMA model to assess predictive performance and real-world use. Please note, the data has been masked to maintain privacy.

### Methodology
1. Data cleansing (date parsing, removal of missing values)
2. Data preparation (indexing, sorting, frequency checks)
3. Exploratory data analysis (trend, seasonality, residuals)
4. Baseine benchmarking (seasonal naive model)
5. Modelling predictions (SARIMA)
6. Evaluation (RMSE and MAPE)
