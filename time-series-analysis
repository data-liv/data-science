# Time Series Forecasting with Python

## Overview
This repository contains a time series forecasting project completed in Python. The object was to extract and prepare a time series dataset, create a benchmark time series forecast, and evaluate this against a SARIMA model to assess predictive performance and real-world use. Please note, the data has been masked to maintain privacy.

## Methodology
1. Data cleansing (date parsing, removal of missing values)
2. Data preparation (indexing, sorting, frequency checks)
3. Exploratory data analysis (trend, seasonality, residuals)
4. Baseine benchmarking (seasonal naive model)
5. Modelling predictions (SARIMA)
6. Evaluation (RMSE and MAPE)

### Step 1: Data cleansing
After the relevant libraries and dataset were loadded into the Python environment, the date column was converted to date/time format and indexed to prepare for analysis.  A sense check was performed using the df.head() and df.info() functions revealing several inconsistencies within the data. Investigation highlighted that the accounting system was not fully implemented until 2018; consequently, any prior data was dropped from the dataset.

'''python 
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df = df.set_index('date')
df = df.sort_index()
